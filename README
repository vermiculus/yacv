* Organization
** Meta
yaCV uses a couple of words:
- module :: an entire group of functionality, e.g. =util=,
            =employment=, and =education=.
- library :: one part of a module; a single =sty= file.
** yaCV
yaCV uses a simple structure to clearly separate logic from
presentation.  This structure is manifested similarly to how TikZ
organizes its own libraries; each module of yaCV must adhere to a
strict naming scheme:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  yacv.util.logic.sty
  
  yacv.employment.logic.sty
  yacv.employment.presentation.spaced.sty
  yacv.employment.presentation.cramped.sty
  yacv.employment.presentation.  ...  .sty
#+END_EXAMPLE
Thus, when a package is loaded via some document-level command, each
argument's =logic= library is processed first (before any
=presentation= libraries are with =module={pres1, pres2}=).  (This is
handled via the =unknown= key in =l3keys=.)  When each logic library
has been loaded (and all document /logic/ is defined), each requested
presentation library is loaded.  In this way, presentation libraries
can account for loaded logic libraries, and each module is cohesive.

The main yaCV class merely provides utilities for managing its
component modules.  For example, =yaCV.cls= defines an =l3keys=
module:
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX
  \keys_define:nn { yacv } {
    unknown .code:n { \typeout{received option} }
  }
#+END_SRC
and means for sending messages to the log file.

* Package Loading
in setup macro, load all logic and presentation through
=\yacv_<module>__load:= and add =\yacv_<module>__initialize:= to
=\AtBeginDocument=.
** TODO might be weird.  test.
